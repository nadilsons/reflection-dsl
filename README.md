Reflection DSL
=========

What is it?

Reflection DSL is a library intended to ease (a lot) the use of reflection on Java.

Reflection DSL comes in three different flavours:

- DSL
- Criterion
- RQL


The two last ones, Criterion and RQL, abstract a Class as an Database table, and uses a API that should look very familiar to anyone who uses Hibernate.

Take a look at the Wiki pages, and of course, enjoy working with reflection!
